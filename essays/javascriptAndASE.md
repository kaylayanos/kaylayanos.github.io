Reflection on JavaScript
Before this class, I have never touched JavaScript. I do, however, have prior knowledge and practice with Java. Throughout learning JavaScript, I found it helpful known majority of it due to the similarities with Java. And after learning the basics of JavaScript, I would say that JavaScript could possibly be one of my more favored languages to code in.
My favorite part about JavaScript is the simplicity and how versatile it is. The syntax is simple to understand and read. Because of the simplicity, it makes it easy to implement into what you are trying to do. Throughout the JavaScript module, I was able to refresh my skills and learn a new ways to implement different things. I learned about the strict equality operator, which I thought was cool since there is no int, string, char, etc. in JavaScript. Through the ES6 module, I was able to learn more topics that were new to me such as the differences between the var and let keywords, default parameters, and the spread operator.
Overall, I think that JavaScript is a good programming language to start with as the syntax makes it simple to read and understand. However, even though that JavaScript is a good way to start learning how to code, once you start making larger project, it could be a disadvantage. As I said before, there were no int, string, char, etc. in JavaScript, there is only const, let, and var when declaring a variable. Because of this, there is a possibility for many errors and mix-ups with your different variables.

Workouts of the Day!
If there is one thing that I will never want to experience again, it would be doing a coding problem under high intensity, time-constrained, and stress-inducing circumstances. Yes, it is stressful. No, it is enjoyable. However, I do like this style of learning. Being put under pressure to solve a problem with code helps me take the time to read and really understand the problem and think about my next steps. Software engineering is not only about the code you write, but it is also the planning to get to the solution and the steps you take to get there.
