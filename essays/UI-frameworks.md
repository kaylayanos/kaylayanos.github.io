UI frameworks is probably something that many people look over just because itâ€™s UI. Many developers are most likely more concentrated on the back end of things. However, how will that back-end code be used by the users without a user interface? Using UI frameworks such as Bootstrap helps make the process of creating the UI much more aesthetically pleasing. However, they can be almost as complicated to learn as a new programming language. However, UI is such an important part of a software or program.

## Bootstrap 5
One of the main advantages of using a UI framework like Bootstrap is that it drastically changes the amount of time that could be spent on trying to get it to look good. The framework offers a bunch of pre-designed components such as navigation bars, buttons, and more. Another big advantage of using Bootstrap is that they have cross-browser compatibility meaning that they can work across different browsers and devices to reduce the need to have a separate style for different browsers/devices. 

## My Experience
Personally, I thought that Bootstrap was hard and complex to use. This was my real first experience with UI. It was something that I was slow at first, but with the Bootstrap framework, I was able to see patterns and consistency with the different components that helped me code more efficiently. 

To help me practice Bootstrap, I attempted to recreate [this](https://okomehawaii.menufy.com/) website:

### Real Website:

### Recreation:

It's not 100% exact, but I think that I managed to create a very similar UI. Overall, this assignment was kind of fun and taught me a lot about how to use Bootstrap.
