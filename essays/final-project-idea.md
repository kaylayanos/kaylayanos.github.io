## Overview
The problem: College students need equipment, but they donâ€™t have money to purchase a new one. Instead, they can borrow equipment and other students can loan their equipment. This way, students can borrow equipment with no cost, which builds trust in the UH Manoa community.

The solution: Vendors can display items that others can borrow and any user can send a request to borrow any of them. Users have the right to view two different rating fields: rating as a borrower and rating as a vendor, where each are out of 5 stars. The borrowing rating indicates whether the user returns the item in good condition while the vendor rating indicates overall satisfaction from borrowers. 

## Mock-up Page Ideas
This app would have 3 types of users: public, student, and admin. In the public user, this is where they only have access to the landing page which will have pictures and descriptions of the different type of equipment that other students are loaning out. They will also have access to the log in option and the create account option. For the student user, this is where they would have to create and sign in to get access to their profile. The student users will be able to add items their items, list items, remove their items, report items to admin, view galleries, and a log out options.
