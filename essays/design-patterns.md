## The Garden
Design patterns are an essential part of any application. We can think of the application as a whole as a garden with many different plants that represent the different components. Now, the question is, how do you take care of all the different plants, each with different needs? We need a master gardener. In the analogy, the master gardener can be represeneted as the design pattern. Design patterns are general solutions to common problems that occur during software development. They are more of guidelines or templates to make the application more scalable and maintainable. 

## MVVM
The patern that I am most exposed to is MVVM which is model view viewmodel design pattern. In the garden analogy, we can think of the MVVM as the master gardener. The MVVM pattern divides the responsibilities into layers, the model, which can be represented as the soil, the view model, which can be represented by the plants, and the view, which can be represented by the working application.
