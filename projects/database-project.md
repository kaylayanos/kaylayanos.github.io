summary: "Created a simple bank database and interface for my ICS212 class."
---

For my ICS212 class, we had a project where we had to create and implement a database and interface for a bank application. The user was suppose to be able to add, delete, list all, and find information from the database. We were also tasked to find a way to store the data into a txt file, so when you run the program again, the data from when you last ran the program was in the database when you ran it again. In addition to that, we were tasked to create "debug mode" where when you compile the program, if you add the additional words debug into the console, it would run the debug version using global variables. This project was done twice, first in C, then in C++.
