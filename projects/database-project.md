## The Task
For my ICS212 class, we had a project where we had to create and implement a database and interface for a bank application. The user was suppose to be able to add, delete, list all, and find information from the database. We were also tasked to find a way to store the data into a txt file, so when you run the program again, the data from when you last ran the program was in the database when you ran it again. In addition to that, we were tasked to create "debug mode" where when you compile the program, if you add the additional words debug into the console, it would run the debug version using global variables. This project was done twice, first in C, then in C++.

## Challenges
Out of all the assignments in this class, this would be the most challening. I struggled a lot in trying to find a way to make a writeFile and readFile function so that when you exited the program, everything in the database was transferred to a txt file and when you ran the program, the program would read the txt and transfer everything into the database.
